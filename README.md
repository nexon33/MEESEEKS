# Project MEESEEKS

# WIP
Most of the documentation is generated using LLMs and could be incorrect or a placeholder. Also note that the project is still in development and some features may not be fully implemented, most of the code is still in the planning phase and has been generated as a placeholder.

MEESEEKS is a sophisticated C# framework designed to automate and streamline software development tasks through intelligent agent-based operations. It provides comprehensive tooling for code generation, analysis, Docker management, and Git operations.

## Features

- **Intelligent Code Generation**
  - Automated CRUD operations generation
  - Interface and implementation code generation
  - Unit test generation
  - Documentation generation
  - Customizable code style preferences

- **Advanced Code Analysis**
  - Code complexity analysis
  - Issue detection and severity assessment
  - Code metrics tracking
  - Location-aware code modifications
  - Context-aware code understanding

- **Docker Integration**
  - Container configuration and management
  - Resource allocation and limits
  - Health check monitoring
  - Network and volume management
  - Port mapping and DNS configuration

- **Git Operations**
  - Repository management
  - Commit handling
  - Remote configuration
  - Authentication management
  - Change tracking

- **Agent-Based Task Execution**
  - Automated task processing
  - Event-driven communication
  - Status monitoring
  - Error handling
  - Task result management

## Architecture

The project is structured into several key components:

### Core Components
- **MeeseeksAgent**: Central component handling task execution, code analysis, and generation
- **CodeGenerator**: Handles all code generation operations
- **CodeAnalyzer**: Performs code analysis and metrics collection
- **DockerOperations**: Manages Docker container operations
- **GitOperations**: Handles Git-related functionality
- **SolutionManager**: Manages solution-level operations

### Models
- **Agent Models**: Configuration and status management
- **Code Analysis Models**: Code metrics and issue tracking
- **Docker Models**: Container and resource configuration
- **Git Models**: Repository and change management
- **Communication Models**: Event and message handling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexon33/MEESEEKS.git
```

2. Ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- .NET 6.0 or later
- Docker (for container operations)
- Git

3. Build the solution:
```bash
dotnet build
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```csharp
// Initialize the MEESEEKS agent
var agent = new MeeseeksAgent(configuration);

// Execute a task
var result = await agent.ExecuteTask(new AgentTask
{
    Type = TaskType.CodeGeneration,
    Parameters = new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        { "type", "crud" },
        { "entity", "User" }
    }
});
```

### Code Generation Example

```csharp
var codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator();
var generatedCode = await codeGenerator.GenerateAsync(new CodeGenerationRequest
{
    SourceFileType = SourceFileType.CSharp,
    StylePreferences = new CodeStylePreferences
    {
        IndentationStyle = IndentationStyle.Spaces,
        NamingConvention = NamingConvention.CamelCase
    }
});
```

### Docker Operations Example

```csharp
var dockerOps = new DockerOperations();
var container = await dockerOps.CreateContainer(new DockerContainerConfig
{
    Image = "your-image:latest",
    Resources = new ContainerResources
    {
        CpuLimit = 2.0,
        MemoryLimit = "2GB"
    }
});
```
